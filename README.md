### Contributing 
As this is just a personal side project, I only work on it when I have time, so I would love your help to make improvements! Just make a pull request and I'll review the changes as soon as I can. 

If you are not a developer, you can also help me greatly by opening issues with bugs you encounter while running the script.

If you would like to see further improvements and updates for free, please consider donating a few dollars as it really helps me to set aside time out of my busy schedule to work on improving the script. All contributions are great appreciated! ðŸ™‚
