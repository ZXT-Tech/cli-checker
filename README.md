# Multi-Site Username Availability Checker

### About
This is a script I made a while back to check the availability of OG words as handles on the various social media platforms. For the most part, it works with any site that has web-based profile pages.

### TODO
- Proxy support
- Multi-threading support

### Known Supported Services
- Twitter
- Instagram (partial support)
- Steam ID URLs
- Steam Group URLs
- Beam.pro
- Github

### Known Unsupported Services
- Snapchat

### Comptability
The script is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.0+ on all OS platforms capable of running Python.

Also, for those with an iOS device, I have built it with [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) compatbility in mind. However, you will need to install [Stash](https://github.com/ywangd/stash) inside Pythonista in order to install some of the dependencies.

### Contributing 
As this is just a personal side project, I only work on it when I have time, so I would love your help to make improvements! Just make a pull request and I'll review the changes as soon as I can. 

If you are not a developer, you can also help me greatly by opening issues with bugs you encounter while running the script.

If you would like to see further improvements and updates for free, please consider donating a few dollars as it really helps me to set aside time out of my busy schedule to work on improving the script. All contributions are great appreciated! ðŸ™‚
